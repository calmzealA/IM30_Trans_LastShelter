Since childhood, he and a group of other children in the same situation became scavengers for a living. Unlike many of his peers, he developed an interest in electronics and chemicals. \n When he was 14 years old, he developed a homemade bomb which he used to blow up a safe to steal money to eat. He was caught by police in the store, but a local army Hero took notice of his case and made an exception to get him out of prison. He could enter military training if he stayed out of trouble. \n After years of study and training, Ali became an outstanding soldier. At the age of 19, he took part in the famous First Counterattack Against the Zombies during the initial period of the zombie outbreak. Ali has developed various kinds of mines, firebombs, grenades and other weapons that are widely used both in war and in defense against zombies. He is worthy of the nickname King of Blasting.

200645=Raymond was born in a rugby player family, in Manchester, England. His father was the coach of local team, and his mother was the team doctor. Influenced by his family, Raymond had been exercising since childhood, and his physical quality was much better than his peers. \n However, because of the Zombie Virus outbreak, everything has changed. \n Thanks to their excellent physical quality and tenacious will, the Raymonds had been holding out in a Defensive Cover, but were finally breached by the tireless Zombies, and that was the reason why Raymond was separated from his parents who were managing to protect him. Raymond nearly came to a breakdown when he escaped to the safe zone. \n Firmly believed that his parents were still alive, Raymond set foot on the dangerous road to search for his family regardless of the discouragement of residents in town. \n However, the Goddess of Luck did not appear, when saving the 13th Survivor, the wounded who was actually infected suddenly became mad and bit Raymond's right arm. \n Raymond was infected. \n Raymond ran away from the crowd by controlling his gradually rigid body, became unconscious inside the City with corpses lying on the ground, and waited for the death alone. \n Not knowing how long, Raymond became awake, thinking of being in the hell, and realized he could still smell the rotten stink of Zombies in the air. Wanting to reach out and rub his eyes, he found a mutation occurred in the right arm, and this change was spreading all over the body at a perceptible speed. Raymond was a lucky dog. This mutation has surprisingly reinforced his physique. Because of this, Raymond could set foot on the road to search for his relatives again, even at this moment, his appearance was no longer the same as a normal human. \n Raymond still remembers the terror of gaze from the first human who saw him after his rebirth, and his trembling arm when pulling the gun and pulling the trigger. It was not until people saw Raymond saving one after another human being from Zombies, did they begin to accept Raymond. \n Raymond's deeds have been spread, and the Z Organization found him, which has discovered his ability to control Zombies caused by the mutation. \n Raymond, who has become more and more weird, joined in the Z Organization to look for his parents, and did not mind saving some people without difficulty.

Now the Last Shelter project team would like to say thanks to all the players who have participated in this test and provided valuable comments and suggestions. These will help us modify and optimize the game for the benefit of everyone. During testing, we've collected your and many other players' comments and suggestions through the in-game feedback system and forum, prompting us to continue our efforts to make the game better. This huge achievement is all due to your tireless support during the beta period! Our team has evaluated the feature feedback you gave this time for quantity and quality and chosen three rewards. However, since you provided too little feedback or the bugs you reported were not verified, you couldn't earn any rewards this time.

As an only child, she enjoyed the generosity of her father and could only be described as having been born with a silver spoon in her mouth. \n Since childhood, Natasha was showered with endless love and gifts which turned her into a spoiled and unruly child. \n Her father was frequently away on business and her home lacked discipline. When her father returned from a long trip and saw how uncontrollable his daughter had become, he forced her to enter Russia's most famous military academy. She had to complete military school or he would disown her and revoke her inheritance. \n Natasha was initially bored and angry at military school, but there she met an important mentor - a veteran of the KGB Intelligence Service. After 5 years of his training, Natasha became an international agent with skills to rival her mentor's. \n After the zombie outbreak, Natasha joined the Z Organization with her father's support. She became the Z Organization's intelligence chief. Because her father generously supplies arms to the Z Org, her influence is already large and growing every year.

William worked on the farm more than he went to school, and he was satisfied with helping providing for his family. At the age of 18, he was called into the army and began a 12 year army career. As a 30 year old veteran, he returned home and married his childhood sweetheart. \n William was 50 with a married son when the zombie outbreak happened. A large scale zombie attack hit his town, and his once happy family was destroyed in the blink of an eye. His family was killed, and as his house collapsed William was crushed by a falling beam. A local Z organization unit rescued him from the ruins, but William's spine was crushed in the collapse and he was left paralyzed from the waist down. \n His paralyzed body could not stop William's anger and desire for revenge against the zombies.

While defending against a zombie attack, Zane’s brother was captured by human bandits. With the help of his new friend and ally Riley, Zane fought his way into the bandit camp, defeated their leader and rescued his brother. But by the time he returned to his home down, zombies had overrun its defenses and most of the inhabitants had fled or had been killed. Realizing they were too few to defend their town, Zane struck out with Riley and a small band of inhabitants to look for a larger group to join. \n He became famous for using his construction experience to rebuild and repair damaged settlements wherever he went. Quiet, but idealistic, Zane refused to leave even 1 person behind and rushed into battle with no regard for his personal safety. He was quickly recruited into the Z Organization. He gained the name “Tip of the Spear” by leading the Z Organization Vanguard when attacking Zombies or bandits alike.

Prior to age 24, his life revolved around alcohol, drugs and women. \n After the Zombie virus outbreak, the world was plunged into chaos. Governments shut down and anarchy reigned in the streets. Fear for his family finally led Johnny to change his ways. In order to protect his little sister, he had to arm himself with weapons and fight zombies and gangs to survive. \n While learning how to fight in the streets, Johnny and his sister barely managed to survive. Realizing that they could not survive like that forever, Johnny began to look for a group that could protect his sister. He journeyed through the streets, searching for trustworthy allies. Eventually, Johnny formed a team of strong men and women that could survive the zombie outbreak. This team, called Salvation, embodies the Last Shelter spirit.

80000463=Commander:\n\n We received the drawings from Dr. O'Connell and carefully analyzed the building designs. The buildings are well suited for the harsh desert environment. They will protect our forces during combat operations in the desert. Here is a brief introduction about these buildings:\n\n 1. Transport Troops Camp: Rest camp for transport troops. Constructing this building can greatly increase gathering speed.\n\n 2. Gold Coin Mint: This factory produces imitation Pharaoh's Gold Coins. Build this building to regularly produce Pharaoh's Gold Coins, which are a very rare resource.\n\n 3. Archaeological Camp: Rest camp for the archaeological team. Build this building to increase your chances of finding buried treasure during the collection process.\n\n 4. Desert Combat Base: Deployment and mobilization site for the Desert Conflict. Build this building to significantly enhance troop Siege Attack, Siege Defense and other properties.\n\n 5. Desert Transport Platform: Designed to support armies marching in the thick dust and sand of the Desert Oasis. Build this building to significantly increase Marching Speed, Single Army Max and other properties.\n\n 6. Desert Fortress: Maximum protection for your City's soldiers in the desert. Build this building to significantly enhance Defender Attack, Defender Defense and other properties.\n\n 7. Oasis Hospital: An important medical and logistics center in the Desert Oasis. Build this building to significantly increase Max Wounded, Wounded Recovery Speed and other properties.\n\n Due to the harsh desert climate, we cannot take the buildings outside of the Walls with us to the Desert Oasis. We were able to build a Desert Garrison and Oasis Resource Warehouse.\n\n The Desert Garrison consists of shelters and first-aid tents. It is a temporary garrison for the Desert Oasis where wounded soldiers can be treated.\n\n The Oasis Resource Warehouse stores resources from your original State. You can receive resources here regularly (using the same method as Farms, Oil Wells etc. from the original State).\n\n >>>You can spend some Pharaoh's Gold Coins on the open space outside of your Walls, but I must remind you that these buildings will be demolished at the end of the Desert Expedition. You will not be able to move them back to your original State.<<<\n\n --From your Construction Team

In the Z Organization, you may be unfamiliar with your own instructor, even the adjutant who has carried out the same operation with you, but you are unable to not recognize this fat Evan. \n However, in fact, the Z Organization will never recruit a mediocre person. Evan’s ability is to make the economy of the entire organization run methodically. He always knows the supply and demand of both sides, and will come up with win-win conditions which both sides cannot resist. He can always bring the competitiveness that others cannot catch up with. Depending on his powerful commercial ability, Evan provides over 60% of the entire organization's capital. \n When doing business, Evan is cunning. He will struggle for each percent of interest with his shrewd words and financial acuity, but Evan will never obey his principles: no fraud, no tricks. People jokingly call Evan a principled fatty. Just as Evan always says: Being avaricious of money but not fond of money is the real way to be rich.

During a battle with zombies, Okita was severely injured and was close to death. \n The Z Organization rushed Okita into surgery, and his life was saved by the famous Dr. John Stark. Due to his ninja skills, this global peacekeeping organization believed that Okita could play an important role in the battle against the zombies. Because of his serious injuries, however, Okita could not fight at anywhere near the level he once was able to. The Z Organization agreed to rebuild his body using experimental technology, but only if Okita agreed to commit himself to the Z Organization and fight at their command. After a series of surgeries to enhance his body with robotic technology, Okita became even faster and more agile than before and raised his ninja skills to a superhuman level. After being turned into a living weapon Okita ruthlessly goes about his mission to remove all zombies from the world.

79011234=Born in Ireland to an ordinary fishing family, Shawn fished at sea with his parents since childhood and became proficient with fishing gear and harpoons. At 25, he was married to his childhood sweetheart and had a young daughter. Life wasn't easy, but it was happy. \n After the zombie outbreak, fishing was affected as wide scale dumping of waste, bodies and dead zombies into the ocean took place. After a particularly bad zombie dump, Shawn and his family were infected by eating tainted fish. His frail wife didn't survive long, leaving Shawn to journey with his young daughter for help. Shawn and his daughter survived for months - something never before seen by those infected - but were turned away from settlement after settlement because they showed signs of infection. After being chased from yet another survivor base, Shawn and his daughter were attacked by wild zombies and his daughter was carried away. Shawn collapsed in despair as his body finally started to succumb to the long infection from the zombie virus. \n When Shawn woke up, he found that he had been rescued by the LastShelter Organization. They were able to stop the progression of the virus, but could not remove it from his body. Shawn was not a zombie, but not fully human either. \n LastShelter joined the Z Organization, and the zombie virus infection made him extremely powerful on the battlefield. Later, he became famous as the powerful Zombie Hunter.

Without a strict hierarchy or social class, sometimes with stone cold strength, there is no lack of human kindness. The Z Organization doesn't restrain its members. Even though some of its members cannot be seen as justice, what Z Organization guarantees is that when facing the threat of Zombies, all Fighters suspend everything to resist the ultimate enemy of entire humanity – Zombies. Everyone here has extraordinary experience, but they have the same persistence. They all possess the determined mind of eradicating the Zombies from the world!
